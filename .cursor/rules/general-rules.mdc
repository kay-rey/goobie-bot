## General Instructions for Goobie-Bot Development

- **Primary Library**: This project uses the `discord.py` library. All Discord-related code should strictly follow the official documentation and best practices for this library. You can find the documentation at: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

- **Coding Style**: All Python code must follow the PEP 8 style guide. Use an autoformatter like `black` for reference if needed.

- **String Formatting**: Always use f-strings for formatting strings (e.g., `f"Hello, {name}"`) instead of the `.format()` method or older `%` style.

- **Security**: Never hardcode secrets like API keys or tokens directly in the code. Always load them from environment variables using the `python-dotenv` library and a `.env` file, as we have already planned.

- **Docker Context**: The application is intended to run inside a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi (ARM architecture). Keep this in mind for any file paths or system-level dependencies.

- **Commit Style**: Whenever asked for a commit message, always make a seperate title and description of the commit message and always use the conventional commits specification https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
